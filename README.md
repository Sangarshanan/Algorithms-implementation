# Implementing Basic concepts and algorithms

Implementation of the some interesting concepts and algorithms to help understand them better

## Bird is the word bot

A-well-a bird bird bird, bird is the word 

A-well-a bird bird bird, well-a bird is the word 

cause you gotta know the word 


## K- means algorithm ##

K means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that clusters similar points that are close in an n dimensional space

This is one of the very first algorithms that I was able to comprehend and appreciate, It is incredibly simple and also effective in nature. In My implementation I have first used a library to get the answer in a single step and then implement the algorithm from scratch to verify the correctness.
* Input: The points in the plane inside a txt file
* Output: Centroids of K clusters are saved in the txt file



## Convolutions ##

A convolution is very useful for signal processing in general. There is a lot of complex mathematical theory available for convolutions.

You can use a simple matrix as an image convolution kernel and do some interesting things!

## Deep Dream ##

A base image is used, which is fed to the pre-trained CNN. Then, forward pass is done till a particular layer. Now, to get a sense of what that layer has learned, we need to maximize the activations through that layer.

The gradients of that layer are set equal to the activations from that layer, and then gradient ascent is done on the input image. This maximizes the activations of that layer


However, doing just this much does not produce good images. Various techniques are used to make the resulting image better. Gaussian blurring can be done to make the image smoother.
One main concept in making images better is the use of octaves. Input image is repeatedly downscaled, and gradient ascent is applied to all the images, and then the result is merged into a single output image.

## Open AI Gym ##

A toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.

#### Problem:

A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains". The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.

Gym environment is explored and the car problem is solved without any algorithm.....just common sense


## Mean Encodings ##

Target-based encoding is numerization of categorical variables via target. In this method, we replace the categorical variable with just one new numerical variable and replace each category of the categorical variable with its corresponding probability of the target (if categorical) or average of the target (if numerical). The main drawbacks of this method are its dependency to the distribution of the target, and its lower predictability power compare to the binary encoding method.

## Neural Network

A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempts to identify underlying relationships in a set of data by using a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks have the ability to adapt to changing input so the network produces the best possible result without the need to redesign the output criteria

![alt NN](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence/images/atypical_ann.jpg)

A neural network operates similar to the brain’s neural network. A “neuron” in a neural network is a simple mathematical function capturing and organizing information according to an architecture. The network closely resembles statistical methods such as curve fitting and regression analysis.

A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes. Each node is a perceptron and resembles a multiple linear regression. The perceptron feeds the signal generated by a multiple linear regression into an activation function that may be nonlinear.


## TFIDF 

Using TFIDF and cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between sentences 


## Logistic Regression from scratch

Implementing a Logistic regression model from scratch for solving a binary classification problem (One layer NN)

## UMAP

Executing the UMAP dimensionality reduction technique. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE.

## Scala Projects 

Very basic scala concepts
