Implementation of the some interesting algorithms

## K- means algorithm ##

K means is an unsupervised algorithm that clusters similar points that are close in an n dimensional space

This is one of the very first algorithms that I was able to comprehend and appreciate, It is incredibly simple and also effective in nature. In My implementation I have first used a library to get the answer in a single step and then implement the algorithm from scratch to verify the correctness.
* Input: The points in the plane inside a txt file
* Output: Centroids of K clusters are saved in the txt file
