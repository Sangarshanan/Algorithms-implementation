# Implementing basic concepts and algorithms

Implementation of the some interesting concepts and algorithms to help understand them better

## K- means algorithm ##

K means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that clusters similar points that are close in an n dimensional space

This is one of the very first algorithms that I was able to comprehend and appreciate, It is incredibly simple and also effective in nature. In My implementation I have first used a library to get the answer in a single step and then implement the algorithm from scratch to verify the correctness.
* Input: The points in the plane inside a txt file
* Output: Centroids of K clusters are saved in the txt file

## Convolutions ##

A convolution is very useful for signal processing in general. There is a lot of complex mathematical theory available for convolutions.

You can use a simple matrix as an image convolution kernel and do some interesting things!
