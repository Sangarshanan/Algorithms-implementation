# Deep Dream ( Getting high with AI)

Deep Dream is an algorithm that locates and alters patterns that it identifies in digital pictures. Then it serves up those radically tweaked images for human eyes to see. The results veer from silly to artistic to nightmarish, depending on the input data and the specific parameters 

In layman's terms, it's basically as if you're playing the game Telephone. One person thinks of a word or a phrase and whispers it to the next person. The next person tells the next person what they thought they heard, and so on down the line. By the end, the phrase is usually indistinguishable from the original. Same principle here.

It's like it's seeing something, trying to identify what it is. It takes a guess at what it is (using a vastly complex CNN). Then it kind of eggs itself on and says, what do you think you're seeing? You totally got that right. Now let's do it again for what you think you saw. This process is repeated, and the result is massively distorted as a result.
